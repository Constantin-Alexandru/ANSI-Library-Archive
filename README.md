ANSI LIB
=========

ANSI Lib is a multi-language library that makes the use of
[ANSI Escape Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) easier.

## Languages supported

The ANSI Lib library has support for multiple languages, with more planned.
Currently, ANSI Lib has support (and planned support) for the following languages:

- [x] [C/C++](https://github.com/Constantin-Alexandru/ANSI-Library/tree/C-library)
- [x] [Javascript](https://github.com/Constantin-Alexandru/ANSI-Library/tree/JS-library)
- [ ] Typescript

## How to use

The way to use it differs based on the language.

### C/C++

To use ANSI Lib in any C/C++ project, just download the `ansi_lib.h` file and
add it to your includes folder, and you are up and running.

Due to compatibility reasons for some terminal emulators, the function `setupConsole()`
must be called before utilizing the library.

### Javascript

To use ANSI Lib in any Javascript project, you will need to install it using `npm`
using the following command:

```bash
> npm i ansi-lib
```

***Note:*** The library will not work for browser terminals.
